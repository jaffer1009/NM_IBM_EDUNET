Description : This repository contains a Python implementation of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for stock prediction. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.
Introduction : Stock prediction is a challenging problem due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets. LSTM networks offer a powerful tool for modeling sequential data and have been successfully applied to stock price prediction tasks.
LSTM networks are capable of learning from historical stock data, identifying patterns, and making predictions about future price movements. By processing sequential data such as historical stock prices, trading volumes, and relevant financial indicators, LSTM models can capture temporal dependencies and generate accurate forecasts.
This repository provides a Python implementation of LSTM networks specifically tailored for stock prediction tasks. It includes code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, allowing users to easily experiment with LSTM-based stock prediction models.
